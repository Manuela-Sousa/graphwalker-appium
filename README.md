# GraphWalker_Appium
This is a simple example of using GraphWalker with Appium.

1- In order to run this code, you need to start the Appium server, i suggest using the Appium Desktop. And indicate in the code what is the host to be used.

2- Create an emulator in Android Studio and open or use a physical mobile phone connect by ADB. Indicate what are the capabilities where the tests are going to be running. 

3- You must either indicate the correct path for the apk.

If you have any suggestion or this code is useful for you, let me know.

Thank you
